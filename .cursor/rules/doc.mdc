# Editing the documenation

## Key Documentation

- @docs/glossary.md: Technical definitions to use

## Rules

### Links

Repetitions should be avoided. Prefer using links to other pages of the documentation
instead of repeating information.

### Outdated information

When you find a contradiction in the documentation or when the documentation contradicts
know behavior of the system signal it to the user and propose a fix.

### Glossary

When appropriate use the words from the glossary. You should avoid using similar 
words to avoid ambiguities. When you use many words from the glossary you can
add a link to the glossary to help the reader.
