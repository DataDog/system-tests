# PR Review Guidelines

## Test Activation/Deactivation Changes

When reviewing PRs that include changes to test activation or deactivation (manifest files or test decorators), you must verify that all modifications comply with the rules and guidelines documented in:

- [skip-tests.md](mdc:docs/write/skip-tests.md) - When and how to use decorators vs manifests
- [manifest.md](mdc:docs/write/manifest.md) - Manifest file format, syntax, and best practices

Key verification points:
- Manifests are preferred over decorators when possible
- Correct format and syntax are used
- Version specifications use the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- Special YAML characters are properly quoted
- `bug` and `flaky` markers include JIRA ticket references
