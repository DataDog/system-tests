# What are the system-tests

* This is a repository (system-tests) with system tests for Datadog tracer libraries.
* There are several tracer libraries implemented in different languages: Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, .NET, Go, and Rust.
* We use pytest to implement the tests. The same tests should be valid to test all tracer library implementations: Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, .NET, Go, and Rust.
* The main test scenarios are end-to-end, parametric, SSI, and Kubernetes.
* System-tests is not a performance testing framework.

# Main concepts

* Types of system-tests: we are talking about the scenario types. Use the document [scenarios](mdc:docs/scenarios/README.md) to provide a good answer about the types of system-tests. Give detailed information about each type of scenario. Follow the links for a specific scenario or type of tests.
