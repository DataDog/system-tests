# Activate or deactivate tests

For enabling/disabling tests, refer to these key documentation files:

- @docs/edit/enable-test.md: How to enable tests and test against unmerged changes
- @docs/edit/manifest.md: Using manifest files for test activation/deactivation
- @docs/edit/skip-tests.md: Using decorators and marking tests as skipped
- @docs/edit/versions.md: Version specification guidelines for different languages

Key points to remember to activate or deactivate tests:

1. For test classes/files: Use manifest files in `manifests/` directory
2. For individual test methods: Use decorators in test files
3. Always include JIRA references for bugs
4. Never assume that not adding a test to a language's manifest will disable it - tests run by default unless explicitly disabled
5. Entries in the manifest file MUST be sorted in alphabetical order. After edit a manifest file ALWAYS run the scenario "TEST_THE_TEST" and format.sh before committing changes to ensure code follows the manifest rules.
6. When using @missing_feature/@irrelevant decorators, the condition specifies when to SKIP the test.
7. For update a manifest yml file, never add fields that don't exist in any other manifests files. Use the documentation [manifests files specification](mdc:docs/edit/manifest.md) to be accurate in your modifications.

For common test activation patterns and examples of enabling/disabling tests, see:

1. @docs/edit/manifest.md#example
2. @docs/edit/versions.md#use-cases
3. @docs/edit/skip-tests.md#decorators
