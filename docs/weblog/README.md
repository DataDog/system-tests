# Weblog

A weblog is a web app that system uses to test the library. It mimics what would be a real instrumented HTTP application. A weblog app is required for each platform that the system tests will test. The weblog must implement a number of different endpoints.
Weblog implementations are located in `utils/docker/`.

> Note: a separate document describes [GraphQL Weblog](./graphql_weblog.md).

## Disclaimer

This document describes endpoints implemented on weblog. Though, it's not a complete description, and can contain mistakes. The source of truth are the test itself. If a weblog endpoint passes system tests, then you can consider it as ok. And if it does not passes it, then you must correct it, even if it's in line with this document.

**You are strongly encouraged to help others by submitting corrections when you notice issues with this document.**

## Endpoints

All these endpoints must respond `200` unless noted otherwise. If content is not specified, it means that it is not tested. But for coherence, the most used content should be documented.

### \[GET, POST\] /

The following text may be written to the body of the response:

```
Hello world!\n
```

### GET /headers

This endpoint must set the following headers:

```
content-type: text
content-length: 16
content-language: en-US
```

Note: The content length must be present, whatever the value as long as it's numeric.

The following text may be written to the body of the response:

```
Hello headers!\n
```

### GET /identify

This endpoint must set the following tags on the local root span:

```
usr.id
usr.email
usr.name
usr.session_id
usr.role
usr.scope
```

The value of each tag should be the tag name, for example `usr.id` should be set to `usr.id`.

### GET /identify-propagate

This endpoint must set the following tags on the local root span:

```
_dd.p.usr_id
```

The value of `_dd.p.usr.id` should be `dXNyLmlk`, which is the base64 encoding of `usr.id`.

### GET /params/%s

This endpoint must accept a parameter that is a string and is part of the URL path.

The following text may be written to the body of the response:

```
Hello world!\n
```

### GET /sample_rate_route/%i

This endpoint must accpect a parameter `i` as an integer.

The following text may be written to the body of the response:

```
Hello world!\n
```

### GET /api_security/sampling/%i

This endpoint is used for API security sampling and must accept a parameter `i` as an integer.

The response body may contain the following text:

```
Hello!\n
```

### GET /api_security_sampling/%i

This endpoint is used in conjunction with `GET /api_security/sampling/%i` for API security sampling and must accept a parameter `i` as an integer.

The response body may contain the following text:

```
OK\n
```


### GET /spans

The endpoint may accept two query string parameters:

* `repeats` - this is the number of spans that should be manually created (default `1`). Span must be flatten (not nested)
* `garbage` - this is the number of tags that should added to each a span (default `1`). Tag must be of the form `garbage{i}: Random string`, `i` starting at `0`

The following text should be written to the body of the response:

```
Generated {repeats} spans with {garbage} garbage tags\n
```

Where `repeats` and `garbage` are the parameters read from the query string.

### GET /sqli

The endpoint must accept a query string parameter `q`. This parameter should be used as part of a query that is executed against a real database (to ensure a database span is created).

The output of the query should be written to the body of the response.

### `GET /status`

The endpoint must accept a query string parameter `code`, which should be an integer. This parameter will be the status code of the response message.

### \[All HTTP verbs\] /waf

This is a generic endpoint. It must accept all methods, all content types, all queries and all sub paths, including empty ones.

The following text should be written to the body of the response:

```
Hello world!\n
```

In particular, it accepts and parse JSON and XML content. A typical XML content is :

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<string attack="attr">
    content
</string>
```

### \[GET, POST, OPTIONS\] /tag_value/:tag_value/:status_code

This endpoint must accept two required parameters (the first is a string, the second is an integer) and are part of the URL path.

Make sure the parameters are name :tag_value and :status_code. Those values are use for the test in tests/appsec/api_security/test_schemas.py

This endpoint must accept all query parameters and all content types.

The first path parameter must be written in the span with the tag `appsec.events.system_tests_appsec_event.value` and the parameter as value.

The second path parameter must be used as a response status code.

All query parameters (key, value) must be used as (key, value) in the response headers.

The response for this endpoint must be:

```
Value tagged
```

**There is one exception**

The exception was introduced for testing API Security response body

If the first string parameter (:tag_value) starts with `payload_in_response_body` and the method is `POST`.

Then the response should contain json with the format:

```
{"payload": payload}
```

where payload is the parsed body of the request


Make sure to specify the Content-Type header as `application/json`

#### Example

```
/tag_value/tainted_value/418?Content-Language=fr&custom_field=myvalue
```
must set the appropriate tag in the span to `tainted_value` and return a response with the teapot code with reponse headers populated with `Content-Language=fr` and `custom_field=myvalue`.

The goal is to be able to easily test if a request was blocked before reaching the server code or after by looking at the span and also test security rules on reponse status code or response header content.

This endpoint get a `name` and a `value` form the query string, and adds a header `Set-Cookie` with `{name}={value}` as header value in the HTTP response

### \[GET\] /session/new

This endpoint is the initial endpoint used to test session fingerprints, consequently it must initialize a new session and the web client should be able to deal with the persistence mechanism (e.g. cookies).

Returns the identifier of the created session id. Example :

```text
c377db41-b664-4e30-af57-5df2e803bec7
```

Examples:
- `GET`: `/session/new`

### \[GET\] /session/user

Once a session has been established, a new call to `/session/user` must be made in order to generate a session fingerprint with the session id provided by the web client (e.g. cookie) and the user id provided as a parameter.

Query parameters required in the `GET` method:
- `sdk_user`: user id used in the WAF login event triggered during the execution of the request.

Examples:
- `GET`: `/session/user?sdk_user=sdkUser`

### \[GET\] /mock_s3/put_object

This endpoint is used to test the s3 integration. It creates a bucket if
necessary based on the `bucket` query parameter and puts an object at the `key`
query parameter. The body of the object is just the bytes of the key, encoded
with utf-8. Returns a result object with an `object` JSON object field containing the
`e_tag` field with the ETag of the uploaded object. The `e_tag` field has any
extra double-quotes stripped (accounting for a quirk in the boto3 library).

Examples:
- `GET`: `/mock_s3/put_object?bucket=somebucket&key=somekey`


### \[GET\] /mock_s3/copy_object

This endpoint is used to test the s3 integration. It creates a bucket if
necessary based on the `original_bucket` query parameter and puts an object at
the `original_key` query parameter. The body of the object is just the bytes of
the key, encoded with utf-8. The method then creates another `bucket` if
necessary and copies the object into the `key` location. Returns a result
object with an `object` JSON object field containing the `e_tag` field with the
ETag of the copied object. The `e_tag` field has any extra double-quotes
stripped (accounting for a quirk in the boto3 library).

Examples:
- `GET`: `/mock_s3/copy_object?original_bucket=somebucket&original_key=somekey&bucket=someotherbucket&key=someotherkey`


### \[GET\] /mock_s3/multipart_upload

This endpoint is used to test the s3 integration. It creates a bucket if
necessary based on the `bucket` query parameter and puts an object at the `key`
query parameter. The body of the object is just the bytes of the key, encoded
with utf-8, duplicated enough times to make two multipart uploads. Returns a
result object with an `object` JSON object field containing the `e_tag` field
with the ETag of the uploaded object returned by the final
CompleteMultipartUpload call. The `e_tag` field has any extra double-quotes
stripped (accounting for a quirk in the boto3 library).

Examples:
- `GET`: `/mock_s3/multipart_upload?bucket=somebucket&key=somekey`
