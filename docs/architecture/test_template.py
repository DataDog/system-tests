# *ATTENTION*: Copy this file to the tests folder, modify, and rename with a prefix of `test_` to enable your new tests

# There are ways to mark a test to be skipped in pytest, which may or may not be relevant for your tests.
# Use any of the following examples and add them as decorators on your test class.
#  - Require a specific version condition:
#       @bug(context.library < "golang@1.36.0")
#  - Skip for an entire library:
#       @irrelevant(context.library != "java", reason="*ATTENTION*: The reason the language is skipped")
#  - Skip for every library except one
#       @irrelevant(context.library = "dotnet", reason="only for .NET")

# To run an individual test: ./run.sh tests/test_traces.py::Test_Misc::test_main
