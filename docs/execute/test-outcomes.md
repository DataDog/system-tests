Each test can be flagged with an expected outcomes, with a declaration in [manifests files](../edit/manifest.md) or using inline decorators (`@bug`, `@missing_features` ...).

Those declaration are interpreted by system-tests and impacts the test execution, and the outcome of the entire run :

| Declaration            | Test is executed  | Test actual outcome | System test output  | Comment
| -                      | -                 | -                   | -                   | -
| \<no_declaration>      | Yes               | ‚úÖ Pass             | üü¢ Success          | All good :sunglasses:
| Missing feature or bug | Yes               | ‚ùå Fail             | üü¢ Success          | Expected failure
| Missing feature or bug | Yes               | ‚úÖ Pass             | üü† Success          | XPASS: The feature has been implemented, bug has been fixed -> easy win
