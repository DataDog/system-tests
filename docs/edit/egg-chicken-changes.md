As system-tests lives in a different repo, testing a new feature before merging it is not as straightforward as if the test suite was in your own repo. You mest make your changes on both repo, and, if we were in a perfect world, merge them simultaneously.

We are not in a perfect world, so here is the recipes : 

## The very lazy way 

1. Do your PR in your repo, merge it
2. Do the PR on system-tests, merge it

Totally acceptable, if you accept the risk to do another PR on your repo.

## The lazy way

1. Do a PR in system-tests (it fails)
2. Do your PR in your repo
3. Test it locally
4. Merge your PR on your repo
5. Re-run system-tests PR. In theory, it should be ok.
6. Merge it

You have to run system-tests locally. But you will reduces the risk of rework on your repo, and you keep your `main` branch clean.

## The good way

1. Do a PR in system-tests (it fails)
2. Do your PR in your repo. **On this PR, change the CI to use the system-tests branch**
3. Iterate on both PR until the PR on your repo is ok
4. Very last commit on your PR : **revert the change on your CI that used the dedicated system-tests branch**
5. Merge your PR on your repo
6. Re-run system-tests PR CI. In theory, it should be ok.
7. Merge it.
