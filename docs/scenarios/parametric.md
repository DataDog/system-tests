# APM library parametric tests

The tests in this submodule target a shared interface so that **all** the APM libraries can be tested with a single test case.

This enables us to write unit/integration-style test cases that can be shared.

Example:

```python
from utils.parametric.spec.trace import find_span, find_trace, find_span_in_traces, find_first_span_in_trace_payload, find_root_span

@pytest.mark.parametrize("library_env", [{"DD_ENV": "prod"}])
def test_datadog_spans(library_env, test_library, test_agent):
    with test_library:
        with test_library.start_span("operation") as s1:
            with test_library.start_span("operation1", service="hello", parent_id=s1.span_id) as s2:
                pass

        with test_library.start_span("otel_rocks") as os1:
            pass

    # Waits for 2 traces to be captured and avoids sorting the received spans by start time
    # Here we want to perserve the order of spans to easily access the chunk root span (first span in payload)
    traces = test_agent.wait_for_num_traces(2, sort_by_start=False)
    assert len(traces) == 2, traces

    trace1 = find_trace(traces, s1.trace_id)
    assert len(trace1) == 2

    span1 = find_span(trace1, s1.span_id)
    # Ensure span1 is the root span of trace1
    assert span1 == find_root_span(trace1)
    assert span1["name"] == "operation"

    span2 = find_span(trace1, s2.span_id)
    assert span2["name"] == "operation1"
    assert span2["service"] == "hello"

    # Chunk root span can be span1 or span2 depending on how the trace was serialized
    # This span will contain trace level tags (ex: _dd.p.tid)
    first_span = find_first_span_in_trace_payload(trace1)
    # Make sure trace level tags exist on the chunk root span
    assert "language" in first_span["meta"]
    assert first_span["meta"]["env"] == "prod"

    # Get one span from the list of captured traces
    ospan = find_span_in_traces(traces, os1.trace_id, os1.span_id)
    assert ospan["resource"] == "otel_rocks"
    assert ospan["meta"]["env"] == "prod"
```

- This test case runs against all the APM libraries and is parameterized with two different environments specifying two different values of the environment variable `DD_ENV`.
- The test case creates a new span and sets a tag on it using the shared HTTP interface.
- The implementations of the HTTP interface, by language, are in `utils/build/docker/<lang>/parametric`. See here for exact locations per langugage: [Http Server Implementations](#http-server-implementations) for more details.
- Data is flushed to the test agent after the with test_library block closes.
- Data is retrieved using the `test_agent` fixture and asserted on.


## Usage


### Installation

Make sure you're in the root of the repository before running these commands.

The following dependencies are required to run the tests locally:

- Docker
- Python 3.12

### Running the tests

Build will happen at the beginning of the run statements.

Run all the tests for a particular tracer library:

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC
```

Run a specific test (`test_metrics_msgpack_serialization_TS001`):

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -k test_metrics_msgpack_serialization_TS001
```

Run all tests matching pattern

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -k test_metrics_
```

Tests can be aborted using CTRL-C but note that containers maybe still be running and will have to be shut down.

### Running the tests for a custom tracer
To run tests against custom tracer builds, refer to the [Binaries Documentation](../execute/binaries.md)

#### After Testing with a Custom Tracer:
Note: Most of the ways to run system-tests with a custom tracer version involve modifying the binaries directory. Modifying the binaries will alter the tracer version used across your local computer. Once you're done testing with the custom tracer, ensure you **remove** it. For example for Python:
```bash
rm -rf binaries/python-load-from-pip
```

### Using Pytest

The tests are executed using pytest. Below are some common command-line options you can use to control and customize your test runs.
- `-k EXPRESSION`: Run tests that match the given expression (substring or pattern). Useful for running specific tests or groups of tests.

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -k test_metrics_msgpack_serialization_TS001
```

- `-L`: To specifiy a language using an argument rather than env
```sh
./run.sh PARAMETRIC -L dotnet -k test_metrics_msgpack_serialization_TS001
```

- `-v`: Increase verbosity. Shows each test name and its result (pass/fail) as they are run.

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -v
```

- `-vv`: Even more verbose output. Provides detailed information including setup and teardown for each test.

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -vv -k test_metrics_
```

- `-s`: Disable output capture. Allows you to see print statements and logs directly in the console.

```sh
TEST_LIBRARY=dotnet ./run.sh PARAMETRIC -s
```

### Understanding the test outcomes
Please refer to this [chart](docs/execute/test-outcomes.md)

### Debugging

The stdout and stderr logs of the test run will include the output from the library server and the test agent container.
These can be used to debug the test case.

The output also contains the commands used to build and run the containers which can be run manually to debug the issue
further.

The logs are contained in this folder:  `./logs_parametric`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure docker is running.
- Ensure you do not have a datadog agent running outside the tests (`ps aux | grep 'datadog'` can help you check this).
- Exiting the tests abruptly maybe leave some docker containers running. Use `docker ps` to find and `docker kill` any
  containers that may still be running.

### Tests failing locally but not in CI

A cause for this can be that the Docker image containing the APM library is cached locally with an older version of the
library. Deleting the image will force a rebuild which will resolve the issue.

```sh
docker image rm <library>-test-library
```

### Disable build kit

If logs like

```
Failed to fire hook: while creating logrus local file hook: user: Current requires cgo or $USER, $HOME set in environment
[2023-01-04T21:44:49.583965000Z][docker-credential-desktop][F] get system info: exec: "sw_vers": executable file not found in $PATH
[goroutine 1 [running, locked to thread]:
[common/pkg/system.init.0()
[	common/pkg/system/os_info.go:32 +0x1bc
#3 ERROR: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out: ``
```

are being produced then likely build kit has to be disabled.

To do that open the Docker UI > Docker Engine. Change `buildkit: true` to `buildkit: false` and restart Docker.

### Docker Cleanup
If you encounter an excessive number of errors during your workflow, one potential solution is to perform a cleanup of Docker resources. This can help resolve issues related to corrupted containers, dangling images, or unused volumes that might be causing conflicts.

```sh
docker system prune
```

**⚠️ Warning:**
Executing `docker system prune` will remove all stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build caches. This action is **irreversible** and may result in the loss of important data. Ensure that you **do not** need any of these resources before proceeding.

## Developing the tests

### Extending the interface

The Python implementation of the interface `app/python`, when run, provides a specification of the API when run.
See the steps below in the HTTP section to run the Python server and view the specification.

### Shared Interface

To view the available HTTP endpoints , follow these steps:
Note: These are based off of the Python tracer's http server which should be held as the standard example interface across implementations.


1. `./utils/scripts/parametric/run_reference_http.sh`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs in your web browser to access the documentation.
3. You can download the OpenAPI schema from http://localhost:8000/openapi.json. This schema can be imported into tools like [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/) or other API clients to facilitate development and testing.


### Architecture: How System-tests work

Below is an overview of how the testing architecture is structured:

- Shared Tests in Python: We write shared test cases using Python's pytest framework. These tests are designed to be generic and interact with the tracers through an HTTP interface.
- HTTP Servers in Docker: For each language tracer, we build and run an HTTP server within a Docker container. These servers expose the required endpoints defined in the OpenAPI schema and handle the tracer-specific logic.
- [Test Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-apm-test-agent/) in Docker: We start a test agent in a separate Docker container. This agent collects data (such as spans and traces) submitted by the HTTP servers. It serves as a centralized point for aggregating and accessing test data.
- Test Execution: The Python test cases use a [HTTP client](/utils/parametric/_library_client.py) to communicate with the servers. The servers generate data based on the interactions, which is then sent to the test agent. The tests can query the test agent to retrieve data (often traces) and perform assertions to verify correct behavior.

An example of how to get a span from the test agent:
```python
span = find_only_span(test_agent.wait_for_num_traces(1))
```

This architecture allows us to ensure that all tracers conform to the same interface and behavior, making it easier to maintain consistency across different languages and implementations.
