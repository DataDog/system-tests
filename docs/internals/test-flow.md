Here is the execution flow of tests

## end-to-end scenario

### Normal mode

1. The infra is spawned
2. All tests are collected, tests that are not in the executed scenario are removed
3. for each tests, if the test is a method class, and a setup method exists in this class (test is named `test_XXX`, setup method name must be `setup_XXX`), the setup method is executed.
4. Every data generated by the setup method is stored (actually, only requests made on the weblog, but soon all of them)
5. the infra is shut down
6. all the test method are executed

### Replay mode

1. All tests are collected, tests that are not in the executed scenario are removed
2. data generated by the setup method is recreated
6. all the test method are executed

## Parametric scenario
