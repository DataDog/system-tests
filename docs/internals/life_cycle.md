## Docker compose

The docker compose file includes several dependancies between each services. Here is the startup diagram of all services:

```mermaid
graph TD
    runner --> agent 
    agent --> weblog
    runner --> weblog
    cassandra[(cassandra)] ----> weblog
    mongo[(mongo)] ----> weblog
```

## Warmup

Once the runner is started, it waits for several signals (defined in `execute_warmups` function) before starting the test session: 

1. A successful request on `agent` service
2. A successful request on `weblog` service
3. A successful communication between `weblog` and `agent`
4. A successful communication between `agent` and datadog backend
