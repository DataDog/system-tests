It's a straightforward linear equation \u2013 a single step to isolate the variable.  My mind immediately jumps to the process.  The equation's x + 9 = 10.  The goal is crystal clear: get 'x' all alone on one side.\\n\\nThe '+ 9' is the obstacle.  I know the principle: I have to do the *opposite* of addition to get rid of it. Subtraction. And, crucially, whatever I do to one side of the equation, I must do to the *other* to keep things balanced.\\n\\nSo, I subtract 9 from both sides: (x + 9) - 9 = 10 - 9. That means on the left side, the '+9' and '-9' cancel each other out, leaving just 'x'.  On the right side, 10 minus 9 is 1.\\n\\nThe simplified equation then becomes x = 1.\\n\\nNow, to present this clearly and accessibly to the user. I'd begin with the answer: x = 1.  Then I'd break down the steps:\\n\\n1.  Start with the given equation: x + 9 = 10\\n2.  The goal: Isolate x on one side of the equation.\\n3.  Action: Subtract 9 from both sides.\\n4.  Calculation:\\n    *   x + 9 - 9 = 10 - 9\\n    *   x = 1\\n\\nThen to conclude, the final answer: x = 1.\\n\\nIt's clear, correct, and follows basic algebraic principles, which is perfect.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"To find the value of x, you need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\\n\\nGiven the equation:\\nx + 9 = 10\\n\\nSubtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\\nx + 9 - 9 = 10 - 9\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\nx = 1\\n\\nSo, the value of **x is 1**.\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n      \"finishReason\": \"STOP\",\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usageMetadata\": {\n    \"promptTokenCount\": 18,\n    \"candidatesTokenCount\": 83,\n    \"totalTokenCount\": 579,\n    \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n      {\n        \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n        \"tokenCount\": 18\n      }\n    ],\n    \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 478\n  },\n  \"modelVersion\": \"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n  \"responseId\": \"IclCaZrdF4a1_uMPvtWIqA4\"\n}\n"
