Will not work: Automated login events, user ids, events tracking, usage of AppSec SDK
Not tested due to lack of endpoints in the dummy http app: Block user, Block GraphQL, Fingerprinting
Not tested because the test need appsec to be disabled at first (and in the scenario it's DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=1 at the start): Suspicious Attacker Blocking
