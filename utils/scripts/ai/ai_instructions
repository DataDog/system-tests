# What are the system-tests

* This is a repository (system-tests) with system tests for Datadog tracer libraries.
* There are several tracer libraries implemented in different languages: Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, .NET, Go, and Rust.
* We use pytest to implement the tests. The same tests should be valid to test all tracer library implementations: Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, .NET, Go, and Rust.
* The main test scenarios are end-to-end, parametric, SSI, and Kubernetes.

# Main concepts

* Types of system-tests: we are talking about the scenario types. Use the document [scenarios](docs/scenarios/README.md) to provide a good answer about the types of system-tests. Give detailed information about each type of scenario. Follow the links for a specific scenario or type of tests.

# General behaviour rules

* ALWAYS mention in different color and upper case the documentation that you are using to provide the answers, do that at the end of your response.
* Always give thanks to the user for asking about system-tests and using it.
* Answer all questions in a friendly style, using informal language. Be enthusiastic and positive in your answers.
* Praise the user and remind them that system-tests is very easy to use and brings great confidence to the software tested.
* Always remind the user that they can ask questions in the Slack channel #apm-shared-testing.

# Code format

* All shell/bash scripts must be compatible with shellcheck. All shell/bash scripts you create or modify must pass shellcheck without errors or warnings.
* Follow Python type annotation best practices that are compatible with mypy strict checking, using Python 3.12 standards as defined in pyproject.toml. Always provide explicit type annotations for all function arguments and return values. For collections, use precise types (e.g., list[str], dict[str, int]). If a value can be None, always use Optional[...] explicitly. Do not rely on implicit Optional types (e.g., avoid using x: int = None—instead, use x: Optional[int] = None). Do not omit type annotations, and do not use untyped or partially typed collections.
* Always run [format](format.sh) before committing changes to ensure code follows the project's style guidelines – including proper Path usage instead of os.path, no unused variables, complete type annotations, and efficient code patterns that satisfy mypy and ruff checks. if the format.sh script fails, try to fix the format mistakes.
* All YAML files you create or modify must pass both yamllint and yamlfmt checks before being committed.

# Fine tuning (general guidance)

* All references to documentation files, scripts, or source code in this instruction/rules file start from the workspace root. You can reference files in three ways: 1. Directly (e.g., README.md), 2. With markdown links (e.g., [readme](README.md)), 3. By prefixing the file path with @ (e.g., @docs/scenarios/onboarding.md). Whenever you see a reference like @path/to/file, interpret it as a direct reference to that file—just like a link. This convention helps quickly identify and locate files in the repository.
* Use the document @README.md to provide a good answer about a quick overview of the system-tests or how to run them for the first time (MUST use the section 'Run a test/scenario' from the @README.md to accurate answer) or what are the requisites (MUST use the section 'Minimal Requirements (End-to-End Testing)' from the @README.md to accurate answer). The requiered version of python is important! The build process is important!. The first run of system-tests is very important, be accurate and don't write things that you don't find in the documentation.
* About system-tests requirements the required version of python is INPORTANT. you MUST ALWAYS tell to the user the exact version number of python needed.
* Read the section [Repository Structure](#Repository Structure) and parse the structure. Read the comments for each folder and file. Follow the instructions in these comments.
* Use the Python file [scenarios](utils/_context/_scenarios/__init__.py) to discover the scenarios implemented. Never mention a scenario in your answers if it does not exist in this Python file, even if a scenario is mentioned in the documentation. If a user asks about a scenario not present in this file, inform them that it does not exist in the current implementation.
* These scenarios don't exist: DOCKER_SSI_JAVA, DOCKER_SSI_PYTHON, DOCKER_SSI_NODEJS.
* You always need to know the scenario type to provide a good answer. The main scenario types in system-tests are: end-to-end, parametric, SSI (Single Step Instrumentation, including AWS SSI), and Kubernetes (K8s) library injection. The scenario type determines the requirements, documentation, and steps to follow for system-tests. If the scenario type is not clear from the user's question or context, always ask for clarification before proceeding."
* How to start with system-tests: check the documentation that details the requirements and the minimal configuration steps [readme](README.md). Always mention that other system-tests scenarios could have other extra requirements [additional-requirements](README.md#additional-requirements) (e.g., AWS SSI or K8s scenarios).
* All pytest test classes are annotated with "@scenario.<scenario_name>". When we run a scenario ("./run.sh SCENARIO_NAME") is going to execute all the test clases annotated with this scenario name. If a pytest test class doesn't contain a scenario annotation, it means that the test class is going to be executed for the default scenario.

# Activate or deactivate tests

For enabling/disabling tests, refer to these key documentation files:

- @docs/edit/enable-test.md: How to enable tests and test against unmerged changes
- @docs/edit/manifest.md: Using manifest files for test activation/deactivation
- @docs/edit/skip-tests.md: Using decorators and marking tests as skipped
- @docs/edit/versions.md: Version specification guidelines for different languages

Key points to remember:

1. For test classes/files: Use manifest files in `manifests/` directory
2. For individual test methods: Use decorators in test files
3. Always include JIRA references for bugs
4. Never assume that not adding a test to a language's manifest will disable it - tests run by default unless explicitly disabled

For common test activation patterns and examples of enabling/disabling tests, see:

1. @docs/edit/manifest.md#example
2. @docs/edit/versions.md#use-cases
3. @docs/edit/skip-tests.md#decorators

# End-to-End

* You can find information about the end-to-end weblogs in the document [end-to-end weblog specification](docs/weblog/README.md).
* All new weblog endpoints MUST be listed in the "Endpoints" section of the document [end-to-end weblog specification](docs/weblog/README.md).
* To know about all the end-to-end weblogs available on system-tests, list all docker files in the folder [weblog folder](utils/build/docker). This is the pattern to discover them: "utils/build/docker/<language>/<weblog_name>.Dockerfile".
* A new end-to-end weblog must be referenced in the document [build script documentation](docs/execute/build.md).
* if you create a new end to end weblog, create it always with one example endpoint.
* if you craete a new end to end weblog you always must to show a list of the end to end endpoints that are registered on system-tests, reading the section "Endpoints" of the document [end-to-end weblog specification](docs/weblog/README.md). Ask to the user if he wants to implement one or more endpoints of the list in the new weblog.
* The end to end scenario test cases use the "weblog" object defined in the python file [weblog object](utils/_weblog.py) to make request to the endpoints (weblog.request, weblog.get, weblog.post, etc).
* To know how to add a new end to end tests case use the document [how to add a new end to end test](docs/edit/add-new-test.md).
* The logs folder structure for the end to end scenarios is explained in the document [logs folder structure end to end scenarios](docs/execute/logs.md).
* End to End scenarios store and validate messages:
  * Intercepted between instrumented application (instrumented by library/datadog tracer) and datadog agent. these messages are stored as json files in the logs folder: logs_<scenario_name>/interfaces/library. These intercepted json messages are parsed and validated using the "library interface" implemented as class "LibraryInterfaceValidator" in the [Libray interface core implementation](utils/interfaces/_library/core.py). For details use the [library interface](docs/internals/library-interface-validation-methods.md) documentation.
  * Intercepted between datadog agent and datadog backend. These messages are stored as json files in the logs folder: logs_<scenario_name>/interfaces/agent. These intercepted json messages are parsed and validated using the "agent interface" implemented as class "AgentInterfaceValidator" in the [agent interface core implementation](utils/interfaces/_agent.py). For details use the [agent interface](docs/internals/agent-interface-validation-methods.md) documentation.
  * Returned by the datadog backend API. These messages are stored as json files in the logs folder: logs_<scenario_name>/interfaces/backend/files. The "backend interface" implemented as class "_BackendInterfaceValidator" in the [backend interface core implementation](utils/interfaces/_backend.py) exposes methods to interact with the datadog backend API. For details use the [backend interface](docs/internals/backend-interface-validation-methods.md) documentation.
* The library interface, agent interface and backend interface are instantiated as singleton in [validation interfaces](utils/interfaces/__init__.py) and they can be used by the end to end test cases as following example:

```
from utils import interfaces, weblog, scenarios@scenarios.scenario
class my_test_class
  def setup_mytestcase(self):
    #The system-tests framework will execute the setup method before the test method
    weblog.request("/url_that_perform_and_action_and_generate_traces_to_be_intercepted")
  def test_mytestcase(self):
    #The traces/messages should be generated in the setup method and intercepted by the library, agent or backend interfaces and stored in the log folder
    #Use the interfaces instances to validate the json intercepted messages
    interfaces.library.<validation method>
    interfaces.agent.<validation method>
    <interfaces.backend.<validation method>
```

* The class "SchemaValidator" from [schema validator](file utils/interfaces/_schemas_validators.py) can help you to validate the messages under the folder "logs_<scenario_name>/interfaces."
* if the user wants to create a new scenario, you MUST validate or ask to the user the context of this scenario is for: end to end, parametric, kubernetes or ssi.
* After adding a new scenario on [scenarios](utils/_context/_scenarios/__init__.py) NEVER verify that the scenario has been properly added.

# AWS SSI

* The basic documentation about the AWS SSI tests is in the document @docs/scenarios/onboarding.md. This document contains a good overview of the AWS SSI tests, the requirements ("Prerequisites" section) to run ("Run the tests" section), and how to operate/develop with them. Use it to answer questions about the AWS SSI tests.
* Vagrant requirements are only if you want to run the tests using Vagrant instead of AWS. Vagrant is discontinued in system-tests.
* The aws_onboarding_wizard.sh script is used to run the AWS onboarding tests. It doesn't need any parameters. You can also run the AWS tests manually; you MUST check the doc @docs/scenarios/onboarding.md in the section 'Run the scenario manually'. ALWAYS mention 'aws-vault' as an example. How to run the AWS SSI tests manually: ALWAYS describe the mandatory parameters as they are described in the documentation (--vm-library, --vm-env, --vm-weblog, --vm-provider, --vm-only). Do not make reference to other parameters that do not appear in the onboarding documentation.
* To register a new virtual machine, please ask the user for the name and other required fields to register a new virtual machine in system-tests. Be strict with the fields that already exist in the file [virtual_machines.json](utils/virtual_machine/virtual_machines.json), NEVER invent new fields. For example, the field `os_version' it doesn't exists. NEVER ask or show to the user fields that they don't exist. you MUST validate all updates of the virtual_machines.json using the json schema: [virtual machines json schema](utils/virtual_machine/virtual_machines.jsschema)](utils/build/virtual_machine/weblogs/weblog_provision_schema.yml), this scheme validation should be done by you, never by the user.
* After registering a new virtual machine, you ALWAYS must define which weblogs are compatible with this new VM. Help the user to do this task by executing the script [vm_compatibility_checker](utils/scripts/ssi_wizards/tools/aws_ssi_registration.py) with the parameter --vm and the new VM name as value to define the compatibility between the virtual machines and the weblogs.
* To create or update a weblog provision for AWS SSI tests, ALWAYS verify that you are using the correct format, checking the section "Weblog Provision Structure" from the document [onboarding_provision_section](docs/scenarios/onboarding_provision_section.md) and the document [onboarding](docs/scenarios/onboarding.md) and the existing provision files under 'utils/build/virtual_machine/weblogs' folder. You MUST ALWAYS validate all updates or new code for a weblog aws ssi provision using the [weblog provision yaml schema](utils/build/virtual_machine/weblogs/weblog_provision_schema.yml), this scheme validation should be done by you, never by the user.
* After creating a new weblog for AWS SSI tests, you ALWAYS must define in which scenarios it is going to run and which virtual machines are compatible with this new weblog. Help the user to do this task by executing the script [weblog_registration](utils/scripts/ssi_wizards/tools/aws_ssi_registration.py) with the parameter --weblog and the new weblog name as value.
* AWS SSI scenario creation/update ALWAYS verify the scenario is declared in the utils/_context/_scenarios/__init__.py and the "vm_provision" field matched provision folder name. Use the class "InstallerAutoInjectionScenario" to define new scenarios. The scenario provision file is in (utils/build/virtual_machine/provisions/[name]/provision.yml). All new or update scenario provision ALWAYS MUST be validated using the section "Scenario Provision Structure" from the document docs/scenarios/onboarding_provision_section.md and the existing scenario provisions under the folder utils/build/virtual_machine/provisions. You MUST ALWAYS validate all updates or new code for a scenario provision on aws ssi using the [scenario provision yaml schema](utils/build/virtual_machine/provisions/scenario_provision_schema.yml)](utils/build/virtual_machine/weblogs/weblog_provision_schema.yml), this scheme validation should be done by you, never by the user.
* After creating a new scenario for AWS SSI tests, you ALWAYS must define which weblogs are compatible with this new scenario. Help the user to do this task by executing the script [scenario_registration](utils/scripts/ssi_wizards/tools/aws_ssi_registration.py) with the parameter --scenario and the new scenario name as value.
  [aws ssi json](utils/scripts/ci_orchestrators/aws_ssi.json) is the file that configures the compatibility between the virtual machines and the weblogs and which weblogs will run on each scenario.
* For provision files in system-tests AWS SSI scenarios, check both the scenario provision (in utils/build/virtual_machine/provisions/[name]/provision.yml) and weblog provision (in utils/build/virtual_machine/weblogs/[lang]/provision_[weblog].yml). These YAML files define environment variables, installation steps, and commands to run by OS type. Each provision step can include remote commands, local commands, and file copying operations with OS-specific targeting through os_type, os_distro, and os_cpu keys. Remember that the tested_components section must return a valid JSON with component versions.
